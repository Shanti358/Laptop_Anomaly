# Laptop_Anomaly
The premise and goal of this project is to create a system that monitors the usersâ€™ laptop motion, checking for anomalies. 
The system strives to alert the user if an anomaly is detected with the motion of the laptop that exhibits abnormal activity. It is supposed to detect potential unauthorized access that may be the result of snooping or an insider attack. After an anomaly is detected, cybersecurity measures are integrated to protect the user's personal information. 

Required Items:

Hardware - Arduino Mega 2560, GY-521 Module Sensor, USB Power Supply (for Arduino)
Software - Arduino IDE, Tensorflow Lite, Visual Studio Code (or space to code using your preferred programming language)
